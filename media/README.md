# Project Media & Documentation

**This folder contains supporting material for my ESP32 project where I converted a superloop program into FreeRTOS tasks.**

## Contents:

<ins>🎥 Videos</ins> – Code output demo + complete code review walkthrough.

<ins>📝 Code Reviews</ins> – Explanations of structure, design decisions, and added features.

<ins>🔗 Blog / Links</ins> – References and write-ups about the project process.

📂 Other Media – Screenshots, notes, and supporting documentation.

## Purpose:

This folder is meant to showcase the practical side of the project, beyond just the source code.
* It illustrates how the code runs
* Why certain design choices (like mutex locks, dependencies, helper functions) were made, and
* How the transition from superloop → FreeRTOS simulates real-world IoT scenarios.
